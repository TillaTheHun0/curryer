`murry` keeps your controller separate from your routing logic via curried marshalling. This keeps your controller logic separate from whatever framework you choose to handle web-server routing while currying makes it highly composable and prevents duplicated code

## Currying?

Currying is a technique used in functional programming for buiilding composable reusuable functions. Instead of repeating it, read a good post about currying [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/currying-in-functional-javascript/)

## Marshalling?

From WikiPedia:
```
In computer science, marshalling or marshaling is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission,and it is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another...It simplifies complex communication, using composite objects in order to communicate...
```

The term Mashalling is most commonly used when when talking about objects in memory or serialization for sending objects across a network. `Murry` _technically_ isn't marshalling, but from a high level sense it is; it is taking the shape of some objects, which the programmer cannot control and is external to his or her code, and turns it into a state that our code can work with.

This separates any web-server library specifics from your business logic. This means **controllers are _much_ easier to test**, as they do not require mocking objects created by an external web-server library. It also promotes separation of concerns, as code for extracting data from incoming requests, and responding to those requests is separate from the "meat" of your program.

## How It Works

At the root of `Murry` is a curried function like so:

```javascript
function murryer (errorHandler, extractor, responder, controller) {
  return (...args) { // args given to murry by the web-server library

    // extract the data we want from args
    // pass that data to our controller, which just returns a promise
    // respond to the request using the data provided by the controller

    // catch errors, also handling them as the web-server library would

  }
}
```

Lets go through each argument
- `errorHandler` Function<Function (err: Error)>(...args): a function that itself returns a function that handles any errors that arise while handling a request
- `extractor` Function<Array>(...args): function that extracts the data we want from `args` and returns them as an **Array** these are passed into the controller function
- `responder` Function<Function>(...args): function that itself returns a function that handles responding to the request using the data that resolves from the promise returned from the controller call
- `controller` Function<Promise>(...args): function that returns a promise. What is resolved from the promise returned from the controller will be passed to the responder


`args` is provided by whatever web-server library you use. Since the function is curried, we can pass any number of these arguments and then use _those_ new functions to create any number of flows. This composability compounds for each argument! Utilizing the currying capabilities, you can set up defaults for all or a subset of your `murryers`.

`Murry` has a _tiny_ footprint; It's just a couple functions and some sensisble prebuilt default extractors, responders, and errorHandlers for `ExpressJS`

## Usage

```javascript

import { curryer } from 'murry'

/**
 * With Express JS
 * 
 * Just call next() and pass it an error argument, which tells Express that an error has occurred
 * and immediatley skips all middleware until the error handling middleware
 **/
const errorHandler = (req, res, next) =>
  err => next(err)

// We only pass in our error handler to the curryer
const defaultMurryer = curryer(errorHandler)

/**
 * Set up lots of murryers with different extractors, but with the same error handling!
 * 
 * Extractors always need to return an array.
 **/
const getReqMurryer = defaultMurryer((req, res, next) => [req.params, req.query]) // extract the url params and query string
const postReqMurryer = defaultMurryer((req, res, next) => [req.params, req.body]) // extract the url params and the body
const deleteReqMurryer = defaultMurryer((req, res, next) => [req.params]) // extract just the url params

// Now use those murryers for even more variants!
const postReqJsonResMurryer = postReqMurryer((req, res, next) => data => res.json(data))
const postReqStatusResMurryer= postReqMurryer((req, res, next) => () => res.sendStatus(203))
// ... so on

// =========================================

// Then on a endpoint route somewhere...
import { postReqJsonResMurryer } from '../my.murryers'

router.post('/api/asset/:id', mySweetMiddleware(), postRequestJsonResponse(async (body) => {
  body.type = 'foo'
  // whatever else we do with it
  // post the new asset to the database!
  return { id: 1, ...body } // return mocked new persisted asset
}))
```

In the example above, notice that the constructor has **no** specific logic for handling request objects, or responding to the client, or handling errors. It just returns a `Promise`. You've already set all of that handling up in your `Murryer`! This controller is now encapsulated and kept separate from the web-server library. This makes it **very** easy to unit test without mocking objects for that particular framework that you use.

Decide you want to a different web-server library, say `Restify`, instead of `ExpressJS`? No problem! Just adjust the `Murryer` to extract and repsond w.r.t the new library and your controllers and tests **just work**!

Decide you want different error handling? Just update the one function and **boom**. It's updated for all routes using that `Murryer`.

Need very specific handling for a route? Just compose a `murryer` from scratch without touching your other `murryers`.

The high composability of `murry` allows you to easily write reusable implementation, minimize changes during refactors, and keep your logic **separate** from the web-server library

## With Ramda

Ramda is a great library for embracing functional programming. For example, all Ramda functions are automatically curried. One great tool Ramda provides is the `__` function. `__` can be used as a placeholder for functions being passed to a curry function. Say you needed a `murryer` that used an extractor and responder, but needed to be composable to have different error handling? No problem:

```javascript

import { curryer } from 'murry'
import { __ } from 'ramda'

const extractor = req => [req.body]
const responder = (req, res) => data => res.json(data)

const defaultMurryer = curryer(__, extractor, responder) // placehold the errorHandler
```

Then you can pass in the errorHandler later. This also means arguments passed to the curried function can be provided out of order!

## TODO

- Plugin system for web-server libraries to make `Murry` work out of the box with less boilerplate
- Better docs

## Name
"Marshall + Curry" => "Murry". `Murryer` also rhymes with `Courier` which _sort of_ aligns with the use case for `Murryer` :)
